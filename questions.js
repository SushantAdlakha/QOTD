    explanation: "The Berlin Wall was opened on 9 November 1989 (1), as crowds attacked it with hammers and chisels (2). It had stood for 28 years (3), dividing the city into East and West (4) as a concrete barrier (5) and the great symbol of the Cold War (6). Its famous crossing was Checkpoint Charlie (7); two years earlier Reagan had demanded 'Tear down this wall' (8). Crowds danced on top of it (9), Germany reunified in 1990 (10), it ran past the Brandenburg Gate (11), and it is remembered for falling, not rising (12)."

    explanation: "Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day (1); legend says a falling apple sparked his insight (2). He set out three laws of motion (3) and defined universal gravitation (4).

He later ran the Royal Mint (9), split white light with a prism (10), was knighted in 1705 (11), and was born in 1642 under the old Julian calendar still used in England (12)."
